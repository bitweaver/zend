TO install:

You need to download the ZendFramework from http://framework.zend.com/download 

Unzip in this directory and rename to "framework".

You might need to move some in-development packages like Search to the main library, like:

mv framework/incubator/Zend/Search/ framework/library/Zend/

Be sure the package is active in Admin -> Kernel -> Packages
